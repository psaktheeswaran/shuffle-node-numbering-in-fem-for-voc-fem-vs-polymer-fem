I see what you mean. If you want to randomly shift the values within the same range B1431:E2728 without introducing any new numbers, you can use a formula in Excel. Here's a method to achieve this:

Open your CSV file in Excel.

In an empty column (let's say, column F), you can use a formula to randomly shuffle the values within the range B1431:E2728. You can use the following formula in cell F1431 and then copy it down to F2728:

excel
Copy code
=INDEX($B$1431:$E$2728, RANDBETWEEN(1, ROWS($B$1431:$E$2728)), RANDBETWEEN(1, COLUMNS($B$1431:$E$2728)))
This formula uses the INDEX function to select a random value from the range B1431:E2728 using RANDBETWEEN to generate random row and column numbers within the specified range.

Once you've entered the formula in cell F1431, copy it down to cover all the cells in the range F1431:F2728.

After the formulas have been copied down, you will have the values shuffled randomly within the same range in column F.

If you want to keep the shuffled values and remove the original values, you can copy the values from column F and paste them over the original range B1431:E2728 as values.

Now, your original values in the range B1431:E2728 will be randomly shuffled within the same cells, and you can save the file as a CSV if needed.


=INDEX($B$1431:$E$2728, RANDBETWEEN(1, ROWS($B$1431:$E$2728)), RANDBETWEEN(1, COLUMNS($B$1431:$E$2728)))



=INDEX($B$1431:$E$2728, RANDBETWEEN(1, ROWS($B$1431:$E$2728)), RANDBETWEEN(1, COLUMNS($B$1431:$E$2728)))
